# Sodoku

made by Max Davidoff and Maeve Baksa throughout December 2021 and January 2022. This will generate a random 4x4 sudoku puzzle.

# In order to build something that isn't a precompiled binary, you have to follow the install dependencies file for your specific operating system in the development documentation folder. The precompiled /include path is availabe in the main repository, allowing for mac users to skip installing the dependencies on their system. 

For Mac users, you can simply run:

> g++ main.cpp -lhpdf -lz -o sudokumac.out
> ./sudokumac.out

in the main project folder to run the project directly. Cheers!

If the above doesn't work, going through the development documentation will give further instructions.
